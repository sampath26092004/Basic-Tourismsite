🌐 How It Works
1. HTML (GO-TOUR.html)
> Acts as the backbone of the webpage.

> Includes structural tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>.

> Likely sections include an introduction, list of tours, or highlights.

2. CSS (GO-TOUR.css)

> Styles the layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness.

> No external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) detected—this is handcrafted CSS.

> No JavaScript

> No interactivity, transitions, or API integrations.
